# Fifo Depth Calculation
**Write Process**

* This section explains how the `wr_ptr` pointer works.
* It uses an `always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)` block to react to the rising edge of the clock or a reset signal.
* If the reset signal is active, `wr_ptr` is set to 0 to reset the FIFO.
* If the `write_en` signal is active and the FIFO is not full, `wr_ptr` is increased by 1.

**Read Process**

* This section explains how the `rd_ptr` pointer works.
* It uses an `always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)` block.
* If the reset signal is active, `rd_ptr` is set to 0 to reset the FIFO.
* If the `read_en` signal is active and the FIFO is not empty, `rd_ptr` is increased by 1. 

**FIFO (First-In-First-Out) Memory Buffer**

A FIFO is a type of memory buffer that operates on a first-in, first-out principle. This means that the first data item written into the FIFO is the first one to be read out.

**Verilog Implementation**

This Verilog code implements a synchronous FIFO with configurable depth and data width. Here's a breakdown of its key components and functionality:

**Parameters:**

* **DEPTH:** Determines the number of data entries the FIFO can store.
* **DATA_WIDTH:** Specifies the bit width of each data entry.
* **PTR_SIZE:** Calculated based on `DEPTH`, it defines the size of the pointers used for indexing.

**Inputs:**

* **clk:** Clock signal for synchronization.
* **reset:** Asynchronous reset signal to initialize the FIFO.
* **write_en:** Enable signal to write data into the FIFO.
* **read_en:** Enable signal to read data from the FIFO.
* **data_in:** Input data to be written.

**Outputs:**

* **data_out:** Output data read from the FIFO.
* **empty:** Indicates if the FIFO is empty.
* **full:** Indicates if the FIFO is full.

**Internal Registers:**

* **memory:** An array to store data entries.
* **wr_ptr:** Write pointer to track the next write position.
* **rd_ptr:** Read pointer to track the next read position.
* **empty_reg:** Register to store the empty status.
* **full_reg:** Register to store the full status.

**Functionality:**

1. **Write Process:**
   - When `write_en` is asserted and the FIFO is not full:
     - The `wr_ptr` is incremented.
     - The input data (`data_in`) is written to the memory location pointed to by `wr_ptr`.

2. **Read Process:**
   - When `read_en` is asserted and the FIFO is not empty:
     - The `rd_ptr` is incremented.
     - The data at the memory location pointed to by `rd_ptr` is assigned to `data_out`.

3. **Status Management:**
   - **Empty:** The FIFO is considered empty when the `wr_ptr` and `rd_ptr` are equal.
   - **Full:** The FIFO is considered full when the `wr_ptr` wraps around to the `rd_ptr`.

4. **Reset Behavior:**
   - On reset, all pointers and status registers are initialized.
   - The memory is typically set to a high-impedance state.

**Usage:**

FIFOs are widely used in digital systems to:

- **Buffer data:** Store data temporarily to smooth out data flow between different components.
- **Synchronize data:** Handle data transfer between components operating at different clock speeds.
- **Handle asynchronous events:** Provide a buffer for data generated by asynchronous events.

By understanding the basic principles of FIFO operation and the Verilog implementation, you can effectively design and utilize FIFOs in various digital systems.
